                <div class="disc" style="margin-top: 5px">A personal blog is a blog that's run by an individual
                    author, and they add a “personal
                    touch” to their content by sharing their experiences, writing in a conversational tone, and so on.
                    Personal
                    blogs are NOT those blogs with a ton of guest contributors.<br><br>
                    <b>What is the purpose of a personal blog?</b><br>
                    By having a personal blog, you're going to improve your writing. This is a great school to have
                    whether you end up being a blogger or not. To be able to communicate with the written world is
                    really important. It's also going to help you to think about how you communicate.
